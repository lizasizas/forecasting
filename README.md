# Starbucks Stock Price Prediction (with EDA and Naive Forecasting)

This repository contains code for exploring and predicting Starbucks stock prices using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle: [Starbucks Stock Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankanand2701/starbucks-stock-price-dataset).

## Features:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualize key statistics such as total volume per year and mean price per year.
  - Analyze correlations between different stock price features.
  - Explore the time series data of daily adjusted closing prices.

- **Naive Forecasting:**
  - Implement a naive forecasting approach to predict future prices.
  - Calculate and display performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the predictions.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow (optional, for advanced forecasting)

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lizasizas/starbucks-stock-price-prediction.git
